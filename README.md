# MyRepo
Summary
This project demonstrates the foundational skills I built in R — from writing basic scripts to managing my workflow in Visual Studio Code. I focused on clarity, structure, and documentation — all essential habits for professional development.
What I Did
	•	Wrote and tested over 30 R code snippets covering variables, functions, control flow, and data structures
	•	Set up and configured Visual Studio Code for R development, including GitHub Copilot for assisted coding
	•	Created custom functions to validate input and clean messy data, simulating real-world starter tasks
	•	Practiced version control using Git and GitHub, managing commits and pushing final scripts
