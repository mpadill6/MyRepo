# Course 1 — Project README

## Summary

This project demonstrates the foundational R skills I built — from writing basic scripts to managing my workflow in Visual Studio Code.

## What I did & why it matters

* **Wrote and tested 30+ R code snippets** covering variables, functions, control flow, and data structures — to build reliable, reusable basics.
* **Set up and configured Visual Studio Code** for R development, including GitHub Copilot for assisted coding — to streamline development and reduce friction.
* **Created custom functions** to validate input and clean messy data, simulating real-world starter tasks that improve data quality and downstream analysis.
* **Practiced version control** with Git and GitHub, managing commits and pushing final scripts — to demonstrate reproducible workflow and collaboration readiness.

## Tools & libraries used

* R
* Visual Studio Code
* Git, GitHub, GitHub Copilot
* Base R, **tidyverse** (intro)
* CSV I/O

## Key outputs / takeaways

* Developed a **reusable R function** for detecting and flagging missing values — reused in later projects.
* Completed **100% of autograded labs**, earning full scores on syntax, logic, and structure.
* Gained confidence explaining each line of code in comments and aloud, improving communication and code clarity.

## Reflection

This course helped me move from copy-pasting code to genuinely understanding what I was doing — a big step in my learning. I now think more intentionally about writing readable, maintainable code and feel better prepared to tackle larger, collaborative projects.
